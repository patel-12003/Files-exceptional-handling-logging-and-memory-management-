        "\n",
        "#Q1 What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code or bytecode by a compiler before it is executed,while In interpreted languages, the source code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q2  What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:In python an expection is an event that occurs during programme execution that disrupts the regular flow of code.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:the main purpose of the finally block  in exception handling is to close or finish the open file.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4 What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:it records the state and flow of program , code ,or software.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:The main purpose of the __del__ method is to allow an object to clean up resources it may have acquired during its lifetime, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or deallocating memory in cases where it's necessary.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q6 What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: The import statement brings the entire module into your code,while The from ... import syntax allows you to import specific elements from a module.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:we can handle multiple exceptions in python by using techniques like custom exception handling.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:The main purpose of using the with statement is to automatically close the file when you’re done with it, even if an exception occurs.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: multithreading is happens on one processor where threads share same memory space and resources within a process,while multiprocessing are there where each processor has its own memory space and resource which is isolated from other processor.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:the advantages of using logging in program are better understandind, monitoring, and debugging our code.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q11  What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently managing the allocation, usage, and deallocation of memory resources during the execution of a Python program.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:  The basic steps involved in exception handling are structured using the try, except, else, and finally blocks.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q13 Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Proper memory management leads to better performance, lower memory consumption, and fewer bugs in Python programs.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: By using try and except, Python provides a structured way to deal with errors and ensures that programs run more robustly and gracefully handle unexpected situations.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q15  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Python’s garbage collection system is an automatic memory management mechanism that helps manage the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects in program.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: we want to execute some code only if the try statement is successful and code does not enter into exception.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q17 What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: there are total 5 common levels of logging in python;\n",
        "DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,and CRITICAL.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q18 What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: \"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: if we make file and want to read then without closing it we cannot read it.so,closing file is important to read or execute it.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:the main difference between file.read() & file.readline() is  that the file.read() is used when we want read everything from starting and the\n",
        "file.readline() is used for execute the line.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q21 What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:it records the state and flow of program , code ,or software.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q22 What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: the  os module in python is used for providing functionality to interact with operating system.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:   \"\"\"\n",
